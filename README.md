# Lungo
### A framework for developers who want to design, build and share cross device apps.

## Lungo Framework uses actual & future features of advanced Web Development.

HTML5 Optimized Apps
Lungo Framework supports open web standards, such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It brings consistent browser environment across mobiles, tvs and desktop devices.

Open Source Project
Each new line of code in Lungo is welcome, we hope that Developers and restless minds help us to improve day by day this humble project.

Powerfull JavaScript API
There are many ways to develop apps, and not always is optimized. Lungo offers you a robust API so you can have complete control of everything that happens in your App.

Multi-Device full support
Is known that create apps for each platform is expensive, this situation is increased by the arrival of tablets and SmartTVs. Lungo will suit all of them creating a unique and amazing UX.
